I made my coffee, grabbed all the books and reports, and sat down for the conference call. It was when all the classes, exams, and work were being done on "Work from Home." It was my internship conference call. As dull as it could get, my attention went to Mars. I wondered what would be the gravitational attraction change to us compared to us living here on Earth. Then I thought, "Will I be able to sit on a normal chair?" That further led to "Would normal plastic chairs that we sit on be enough?"


A thought struck me so hard. I realized; these plastic chairs are everywhere! Literally. All over the countries of the Earth. Just then, Globalization seemed very real to me.

A massive Indian wedding seating and enormous trash heap in the Pacific. What is common in both of them? A plastic chair. No matter where we are from, it is very likely that we have already sat in this chair at some point in our life.

This design of the plastic chair that we see all around is called Monobloc. Probably the best-selling chair in history.

It is apparent that we all nix thinking about the aspects that are normal to us.
But astonishingly, Monobloc is getting a lot of hate. So much that in Basel, Switzerland, the chair even became a political issue. For years it was forbidden to place the chair in outdoor areas of restaurants as people complained that they would destroy the cityscape.

How did we even get Monobloc, and is it an example of good or bad design that made it what it is today?
We can find these chairs pretty much everywhere. Outside of cafes in Denmark, inside an office in Tanzania or at the Western Wall in Jerusalem. These Chairs made their way into our lives.

Now for anyone interested in design, chair design is somewhat fascinating because one might think that a chair would be an object that doesn't need to change fundamentally over time, but chairs do change.

Chair design can adapt the shape and material to a specific function. It can break conventions by challenging our idea of what a chair we imagine to be. Just like in designing other objects, designing a chair requires finding ways of functionality and visual appeal. But chair design can also reflect a particular zeitgeist. Like [Marcel Wassily chair](https://www.knoll.com/product/wassily-chair-gold), made out of tubular steel and inspired by bicycle production, which was laying the groundwork for much of modern design. Or pop-art introducing strong color pallets in the 60s and 70s in the advancements in space exploration inspiring futuristic furniture and private homes, like a bunch of [ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_Chair) and [egg-shaped designer chairs](https://www.elledecor.com/shopping/furniture/a14443746/egg-chair-history/). But the Monobloc is different. It is used so widely that it became a sort of meaningless to write about it.


Take a look at this photo. Where was it taken and when?

It is conspicuously impossible to tell.

Ethan Zuckerman, MIT's director of civic media studies, has solidly pointed out the Monobloc as the context-free object. We tend to associate most objects with a particular time and place. If someone shows us a random photo, the chances are that the objects will give us a hint as to when or where the photo was taken. But the Monobloc hardly allows such conclusions to be made.

You might be thinking about why a lot of fuss about a chair. But that's the point. Focusing on this object can allow us to think about more abstract questions. And these conflicting views on a Chair part of the reason why many artists and designers have created artwork using Monoblocs.

The chairs can be found in all parts of the world. And it is an object, so ubiquitous, that if you saw lying around a beach, you couldn't be sure whether someone brought it there or if it is from a different part of the planet. The Monobloc might be a prime example of Globalization, but it can also be a reminder of how locally different our objects around us still are.

There are critical views of this chair, and some rightly know that the Monobloc does not represent sustainable design. Some see the chair as a prime example of mass consumption of uniform goods that disregard any sense of individuality.

There is an essay written by Ingo Niermann, where he says that "white plastic chairs are the real evil of globalization," in reference to that sort of cheap mass production spreading throughout an existing culture.


But now it is too mainstream that the luxurious, Western, scholarly position to be against all parts of Globalization. It's so simple to sit there and state that the spread of corporate force is terrible, the indigenous culture is acceptable, and the Monobloc is a case of this modest expendable culture that is wrecking the local customs.

But what we have to be unequivocally critical about is that their success doesn't come from anywhere. It is because they are affordable. And affordability matters. Since it allows social equality and economic advancement. The Monobloc is a profoundly democratic object.

Furthermore, I found this beautiful [research paper](http://hfej.hfem.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Paper-8-%40-stephenpoon.pdf) that stresses a design that illustrates the modernist utopian way of thinking around social equality and argues that the Monobloc design distributed social equality as much as possible.

Despite being iconoclastic, I am sure many will agree that the many individuals there are truly amped up for approaching the material culture that individuals in the West have. I simply believe it's madly paternalistic to simply sit there and state that needy individuals can't have Monobloc seats since it's awful for their way of life, which Ethan Zuckerman also agrees in his [blog](http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2011/04/06/those-white-plastic-chairs-the-monobloc-and-the-context-free-object/).


But where do these chairs originate from?

Few sources say that the first Monobloc was made in 1946 by Canadian designer DC Simpson (Wiki), and [DW](https://www.dw.com/en/the-global-object-the-monobloc/av-17373066) reports it as vague, as in, a patent has never been applied for. Some people say it is originated in France, and some say it is originated from Italy. However, during those times, the molding process was not suitable for low-cost mass production, and the whole concept might have been anachronous and ahead of its time. But in the '60s, the designer gets interested in the idea of plastic molded chairs. Notably, the [Bofinger chair by Helmut Batzner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bofinger_chair) in 1964 and [Chair Universale by Joe Colombo](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/2515), which was made of several individually molded parts. But maybe the most essential step towards the Monobloc was the introduction of a chair that is now considered a classic in design.

Even if a comparison between the expensive designer chair and the less appreciated garden chair may seem strange, the Panton chair is a technical predecessor since it is the world's first plastic chair that went into production using the same molding methods used in today's Monoblocs. Plus, Verner Panton designed the chair in a way that the chair is stackable. After the success of the Panton chair, several chairs worldwide were inspired by this production method. And with the introduction of cheaper thermoplastic, the path became clear for the mass production of the Monoblocs. Even though some designers launched various designs, it took until 1983 when the Grosfillex group launched their [Resin](https://www.google.com/search?q=grosfillex%2Bresin%2Bgarden%2Bchair&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjyqKCzp7npAhVF6zgGHSx2BfYQ2-cCegQIABAA&amp;oq=grosresin%2Bgarden%2Bchair&amp;gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQARgAMgYIABAHEB5QvF5Yj2Rgq21oAHAAeACAAbMBiAH9A5IBAzEuM5gBAKABAaoBC2d3cy13aXotaW1n&amp;sclient=img&amp;ei=gFjAXvLoA8XW4-EPrOyVsA8&amp;bih=706&amp;biw=1536&amp;imgrc=azDP4qvW30vRTM) [Garden Chair](https://www.google.com/search?q=grosfillex%2Bresin%2Bgarden%2Bchair&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjyqKCzp7npAhVF6zgGHSx2BfYQ2-cCegQIABAA&amp;oq=grosresin%2Bgarden%2Bchair&amp;gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQARgAMgYIABAHEB5QvF5Yj2Rgq21oAHAAeACAAbMBiAH9A5IBAzEuM5gBAKABAaoBC2d3cy13aXotaW1n&amp;sclient=img&amp;ei=gFjAXvLoA8XW4-EPrOyVsA8&amp;bih=706&amp;biw=1536&amp;imgrc=azDP4qvW30vRTM), that the Monobloc was sold in large quantities at a low price.

The chair is produced using Injection Molding. Here, Polypropylene granules are heated to 220 degrees centigrade and injected into a mold that forms the chair. The name Monobloc derives from this method as the end product is made from the single unbroken material.


The molds for such products are very expensive (Rs. 9,300,000/unit). But the production is hugely scalable since it requires little workforce, time, and low material costs. A single-chain production only costs about Rs.700 - 800 and is usually sold around Rs. 1500 and above.

Today, there are dozens of different Monobloc designs available. Once with vertical or horizontal slots or without them, with handles and different shapes and all sorts of different colors. But still, you know a Monobloc when you see one. You could also see the chair as a result of market evolution. The chair has evolved with material thicknesses perfectly adjusted so that there are thin and inexpensive as possible but still stable and durable.
A chair that is weatherproof, stackable, and light. Fundamentally, there is not much we can change about it. It works universally around the globe. Maybe it is the perfect design that fulfills a designer aspires to.
But you might still hate it. And this is where context comes back to play. How we read a design depends on our knowledge of it, and what it reminds us of. Maybe we just don't value it enough. Here and there, white plastic chairs are everywhere, so we might as well start liking them.
