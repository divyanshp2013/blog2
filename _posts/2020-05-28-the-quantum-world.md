The world of science has come very far with its multitude of theories and predictions, but the majority of the public are unaware of some beautiful and mind-blowing theories of how the world works. Here, I would like to talk about the Quantum World, a mysterious and unbelievable land that beats all common sense and understanding, the World of Blackholes, Wormholes, Time Travel, and some other theories.

The articles are devoid of any mathematical formalism, and if you are interested in the Mathematics and Physics behind these theories, I would be glad to write an article on the explanation and delve deeper. These articles are written as hope to show the possibilities, the weirdness, the beauty of the world that we cannot see, and the world we cannot reach.

The theories have different interpretations due to the nature of their predictions. I will keep on adding to these as humanity learns more.



## The Weird Quantum World

A Quantum object, like an Electron, we were taught that it is a wave-particle. How is that possible? When is it a wave, or when is it a particle? What is the wave made up of? What constitutes the particle?

If you have these questions and have ever wondered about this, well, today is your lucky day.

Let us start with the Electron, an Electron in the current highly accepted theories of Physics is defined by a Wave function. A wave function is a complex function that gives a complex number when you input a position in spacetime (t,x,y,z), the complex number that it gives as output is known as the amplitude, the square of which is the probability of finding the Electron at (t,x,y,z).

In Quantum Physics, the position of an electron cannot be known as (t,x,y,z), but it can be known only as P(t,x,y,z), which is the probability of finding the Electron at the given coordinates. This is due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which we will discuss soon. Now when every position in spacetime gives a probability for finding the particle there, the graph of the amplitudes over a region looks like a wave, and they also interact like waves, they interfere which means they cancel and add up at different regions to decrease or increase the amplitude like a wave. The Electron is a wave at all times unobserved, but when the particle is observed, the wave function collapses to one of the possible points in the probable region. So when the wave function collapses, the Electron acts as a particle, with very high amplitude in a small region of space rather than being spread out like a wave. 

The Electron is a wave, an abstract wave of probability that collapses when observed to behave like a particle. The wave is not made up of anything, it is an abstract wave in an abstract space (Hilbert space) that signifies the probability and interacts with the waves of other electrons and itself, and it can collapse to high amplitude like the amplitude ap article would have since it is localized in space. This is what it means when we say the Wave-Particle duality of particles.

What is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle? We cannot know the position and momentum of a particle at the same time with precision is what the principle says, but why?

We have just seen that an electron is a wave and a particle, so when we have a wave, how do we describe the position of the wave and the momentum of the wave? 

The wave is spread out, and a wave cannot have a specific position, but its momentum can be found since waves have momentum (with a better certainty than its position). However, when the wave function collapses to a particle, we have a position for the particle with some certainty, but the momentum is lost as the wave has collapsed. Hence we cannot obtain both the properties at the same time.

The given explanation is not the exact explanation of the uncertainty principle, but it can be shown that the commutator of position and momentum operators is not zero.

The Electron has a variety of properties, like mass charge, spin, and angular momentum; the spin and angular momentum have very interesting Quantum properties. They both are quantized, which means they can only take certain values.

Let us consider the spin of an object like a ball; it is usually in only one direction, but the Electron has spin in multiple directions at once; the phenomenon of having multiple states at the same time is known as superposition. When we observe the Electron, the Electron is forced to take one of the possible states.

Every state has an amplitude which corresponds to a probability. This is where you would have heard of the infamous Schrodinger's cat, it is in multiple states at once, that is dead and alive at the same time when unobserved, but when you peek at the cat, it is either dead or alive. 

The Electron, unfortunately, cannot have all of its angular momentum in one direction (which only serves to complicate things further), say the z-direction, because just like the uncertainty principle, we cannot know the angular momentum of a particle in two orthogonal directions with certainty, which means if the angular momentum is entirely in the z-direction, the angular momentum would be 0 in the x and y directions, but this is forbidden in the Quantum World since we cannot know the angular momentum in two perpendicular directions at the same time. 

One phenomenon specific only to the Quantum World is entanglement, entanglement is when two particles that interact are entangled, let us say two electrons are entangled, now both the electrons are separated and taken to two ends of our universe, the electrons are in a superposition of multiple states, but when only one of the Electron is observed, we immediately know the state of both the electrons since they are entangled and hence correlated, the information of a particle on the other end of the universe is known at speed faster than the speed of light, which is supposed to be impossible. This is weird because there are no hidden variables, and yet particles are correlated across vast distances.



## Probabilities as a sum of infinite possibilities in the Quantum World

In this article, we will discuss the Feynman Path Integral and Feynman Diagrams without any complicated formalism. We are going to see how weirdly, the probability of a simple transition of states of particles, or traversal from point A to point B is a sum of infinite possibilities.

To show how obscure the Quantum World is, let us imagine this, you have to go to your friend's place. You start moving towards their home,  without a doubt you would travel along only one possible path, maybe the shortest or the one with least traffic, out of the infinitely many possible paths, like one that goes to the moon and takes a U-turn and comes back, this seems outlandish but is a possible path. Still, you would traverse only one of the many possible paths.

To make things even more outlandish, let us see the case of an Electron, a Quantum object, if it has to meet its friend another Electron, the Electron travels to its friend in all the possible paths, not the shortest or the longest path, but both?  No, not just both but all possible paths to its friend, a particle traverses all the infinite paths between two points and each of the possible path with an amplitude (probability) with which it follows the path, surprisingly (if "Infinite paths" was not surprising enough) some of the paths can cancel each other out. This arises out of the mathematical formalism of the Feynman Path Integral. Unfortunately, none of this can be physically observed or shown. If observed, the path collapses to one of the infinite paths because observation in the Quantum World disrupts the way systems work, we can see this in multiple cases, that the observer affects results.  

In conclusion, when a single particle has to go from A to B, the amplitude (probability) of it ending up at B from A is obtained by summing the amplitudes of all the possible infinite paths, paths that go out around the moon and back, paths that go around us and end up at B, all of them. When summed over, give the amplitude and hence the probability (which is just the square of the amplitude) of the movement from A to B.

Here is another mind-boggling theory, again by Feynman. Let us imagine two Electrons; the Electron might emit a Photon. The Photon splits into an Electron and Positron (anti-matter version of the Electron) and recombines to make a Photon, which is absorbed by the Electron that emitted it. Another possibility is that the Electron might emit a Photon and absorb it any number of times before it reaches the final state; there are infinitely possible interactions like these. 
 
What happens is, when there are particles, unobserved between two states, it goes through infinitely many possible interactions and reactions with itself and the other particles, this arises out of the mathematical formalism of Feynman Diagrams when Quantum particles (multiple particles) travel from initial to final states, no one can see what happens between the initial and final states, but it has amplitude for ending up at the final state, the amplitude is obtained by summing over the infinite number of possible amplitudes of all the different interactions between the particles.
