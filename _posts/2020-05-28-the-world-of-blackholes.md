Black Holes are one very misunderstood object in the minds of the public. The image of a Black Hole is that of an infinite mass, with infinite curvature that nothing can escape and that it has no other properties. Let's go on a ride to get to know more about Black Holes, the most extreme objects we perceive.

Einstein wrote his equations of general relativity a century ago, and one interesting solution to those equations was the Schwarzchild solution. The solution gave rise to a theoretical object, an object from which, even light couldn't escape, light is the fastest thing in the Universe. Even light couldn't escape these objects? What were these objects that the theory had predicted? 

These objects were Black Holes; they were found to exist in nature many decades after its theoretical discovery. The Black Hole is the core of a collapsed star that has very high curvature beyond a region, the region known as the event horizon, the point of no return. The radius of the event horizon is proportional to the mass. Nothing can escape once it is past the event horizon, no signals can be sent outside, it is a region disconnected from our Universe.

A Black Hole doesn't have infinite mass, but it has the mass of the collapsed star. A Black Hole can only have mass, angular momentum, and charge, and nothing else is what the No-Hair Theorem tells us. At the center of the Black Hole exists its singularity, the singularity is a point in the center of the event horizon, where the metrics that define gravity break down.

Stephen Hawking showed that even though Black Holes that wasn't supposed to let anything out, does act like it emits particles and radiation, this was called Hawking radiation, this occurs due to the event horizon disturbing the quantum fields around it. It was also shown that the Black Hole has temperature inversely proportional to the mass and emits radiation like a black body. This emission of radiation causes the Black Hole, but since the colossal attraction makes them devour a lot of matter, and the slow rate of evaporation makes the time for evaporation, a phenomenon taking a considerable amount of time. Black Holes are very common in the Universe, and they exist in significant numbers in the centers of galaxies.

The things that fall into the Black Hole to an outside observer looks like they never go into the Black Hole, due to time dilation from special relativity. Still, an object that seems to fall into the Black Hole does fall into the Black Hole, and surprisingly its surface area increases not proportional to its volume. A Black Hole is a sphere in spacetime, but the Black Hole acts as a 2-dimensional object at its surface since the information that falls into the Black Hole is added onto its surface. This discovery has led to the Holography Principle that describes a Universe with gravity as a holographic projection of a lower-dimensional gravity-less Universe. 

## Wormholes and Time Travel

Black Holes were theoretical discoveries before they were actually observed, Wormholes are also a theoretical solution of general relativity principle like Black Holes, but Wormholes have not been observed yet. A Wormhole is a shortcut through spacetime. They connect two locally disconnected regions of spacetime and connect them through the bulk. 

One kind of Wormhole is the Einstein-Rosen Bridge, which, before I go forward, let me tell you, spacemen, that unfortunately, is not traversable, there are two Black Holes in different regions connected due to entanglement.

Wormholes may occur naturally in theory, but they collapse due to their instability very quickly, making naturally-occurring Wormholes untraversable too.

Traversable Wormholes are possible to create in theory, but again before you get excited, they require negative mass and negative energy to keep them stable and open. Until now, negative mass and energy are just theoretical concepts unless we find them in nature, which is not very probable.

Now coming to Time Travel, it's possible in theory in two possible ways, one being Wormholes with special conditions, or closed timelike curves. 

Let's explore the possibility, closed timelike curve is a region that is possible in theory that connects a future point back to its past, in a loop, like when we have two Black Holes connected and entangled, with their necks open and with the help of negative energy, then we have to rotate one of the Black Holes at a speed that is relatively significant to the speed of light, so that time dilation happens at one end. 

When one traverses the Wormhole, they will reach into an earlier time than what they would have, if the Black Hole weren't spinning. Hence, back to the past, whose possibility gives rise to many paradoxes. To combat these paradoxes, many rules and conjectures have been proposed. The possibility of these is strictly theoretical until this point, but who knows what will happen in the future.
