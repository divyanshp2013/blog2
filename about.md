## Founder Story

About two years ago, Samarth Vanvi started his investments in Indian Stock Markets. Extensive reading and learning by practice, pillared him for advanced investment strategies. For investing in foreign firms, commodities or currencies, proper knowledge should be available in arm’s reach. 

But the problem he, and pretty much everyone faces, is that lack of “true data”. Data is available for sure, but they are manipulated by either government or big news agencies, that completely overshadows the true facts for any controversial topics. 

So, this led to the foundation of Opinion Quill, as an alternative place for interested readers, who want the real facts posted by related and involved people. All the threads posted here, are to be free from any outer influences, and is purely opinion based. Which might uncover facts that only people know. 

Samarth loved serving those people, who went to depths to get to truth and plan their investments properly. Through years, his interest went far beyond just finance, and reached the horizon of Technological Advancements, Scientific Knowledge, Political Opinions, Philosophical Ideas, Psychological Concepts, and many more topics.

As our platform and team continues to grow, one thing stays the same We as a community to help empower underdog writers and growing journalists. This also helps showcase your opinion to the world.
